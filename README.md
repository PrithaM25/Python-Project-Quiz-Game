**Title: Python Quiz Game**

**Objective:**
The Python Quiz Game is a fun and interactive project designed to test users' knowledge of Python programming concepts. Through a series of multiple-choice questions, players can assess their proficiency in Python while enjoying an engaging gaming experience.

**Features:**

**. Question Bank:** The game contains a curated set of Python-related questions covering various topics such as syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and libraries. 
These questions are stored in a structured format, such as a list or dictionary, within the program.

**. User Interaction:** Upon launching the game, players are prompted to answer each question sequentially. They can input their chosen answer by typing the corresponding letter
(e.g., A, B, C, or D) and pressing Enter.

**. Validation:** After submitting an answer, the game validates the user's response using if-else statements. If the answer is correct, the player earns points and receives positive feedback. Conversely, if the answer is incorrect, the player is notified and no points are awarded.

**. Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of the player's score throughout the quiz. Each correct answer adds points to the player's total score, while incorrect answers do not affect the
score.

**. Feedback:** After answering each question, players receive instant feedback indicating whether their response was correct or incorrect. Additionally, the game displays the correct answer
for any questions answered incorrectly, helping players learn from their mistakes.

**. End of Game Summary:** Once the player completes the quiz, the game provides a summary of their performance, including the total number of questions attempted, the number of correct
answers, and the final score.

**. Option to Retry:** After viewing the summary, players have the option to retry the quiz if they wish to improve their score or reinforce their knowledge of Python concepts.
Implementation:


**implementation steps:**
The game can be implemented using Python's core functionalities, including input/output operations, data structures, and conditional statements. Here's a high-level overview of the 

1) Define the set of Python-related questions and their corresponding answers.
2) Implement a function to display each question and prompt the user for input.
3) Use if-else statements to validate the user's response and update the score accordingly.
4) Display feedback for each question based on the user's input.
5) Calculate the final score and display a summary of the player's performance.
6) Provide an option for the player to retry the quiz if desired.

By leveraging if-else statements along with other Python features, this quiz game project offers an entertaining and educational experience for players of all skill levels.
